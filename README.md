# jupyter-exploration
In this lab session, students will perform basic operations in Jupyter Notebook within 10 minutes. The session will cover the concept of cells, distinguishing between code cells and markdown cells. Students will create and run a code cell to print "Hello, World!" They will also create and format a markdown cell by writing text such as "First markdown cell in Jupyter".
